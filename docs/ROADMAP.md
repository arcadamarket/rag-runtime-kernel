# Development Roadmap — RAG Runtime Kernel

> Organized by release target. Each item references its source finding from test analysis.

---

## v0.2.0 — Released (2026-05-22)

**Paradigm shift: fully autonomous OS-level Python backbone.** LLM role reduced to task assignor, results checker, orchestrator. All bootstrapping, state management, validation, and persistence run as deterministic Python scripts consuming zero LLM tokens.

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| `spec_parser.py` — deterministic MD→RAG parser (610 lines) | Shipped |
| `rag_kernel init --spec` — zero-touch bootstrap from spec | Shipped |
| `rag_kernel configure` — project-specific context merge | Shipped |
| `discover()` — capability self-discovery registry | Shipped |
| `@rag-kernel-manifest` — structured module metadata | Shipped (all 12 modules) |
| Invocation protocol — MUST_USE_KERNEL vs DIRECT_IO_OK | Shipped |
| 64 new tests (401 total) | Shipped |

---

## v3.2.0 — Released (2026-05-27)

Operational hardening release: 51 sections. New §26a Web Access Protocol, §37 Environment Audit. Strengthened Rule 5 (env-switch gate), Rule 9 (web tier gate). Session-zero: requirements.txt + known-issues inheritance. AskUserQuestion echo-back. §41: curl_cffi + Python 3.14 entries. All 8 eBay audit findings (INS-010–017) shipped as spec prose.

---

## v3.1.8 — Released (2026-05-22)

Machine-parseable specification: 25 `rag-config` fenced JSON blocks for deterministic parsing by `spec_parser.py`. Dual-audience document (human prose + structured data). Zero-touch bootstrap target.

---

## v3.1.7 — Released (2026-05-20)

RAG/Memory Reconciliation Release: 48 sections. All behavioral rules consolidated from platform-specific memory into RAG_MASTER.json. New sections: File Sync Protocol (§42), Context Window Management (§43), Resolved Item Protocol (§44), Garbage Collector (§45), RAG as Single Source of Truth with portability guarantee (§46). Known-issues registry expanded.

**Portability milestone:** RAG_MASTER.json is now fully self-contained — a project can be transferred to any LLM platform (Claude, GPT, or any other) by providing either the init prompt OR the RAG file. Both contain the complete behavioral rule set.

---

## v3.1.6 — Released (2026-05-14)

Specification release: 43 sections. Pre-flight gate enforcement, known-issues registry, tool hierarchy with wsl-exec.

All v3.1.4 defect fixes (DEF-001 through DEF-003) and spec clarifications shipped in earlier patch releases.

---

## v0.1.0 — Released (2026-05-14), evolved to v0.2.0

Runtime Bridge: 8 Python modules, 337 tests, 5811 lines. ENFORCED mode live. Superseded by v0.2.0+ (12 modules, 676 tests, zero-touch bootstrap, graduated POV, delta checkpoints, conflict engine, session CLI).

| Component | Status |
|---|---|
| State machine engine | Shipped |
| Persistence engine (atomic writes, WAL, hash verification) | Shipped |
| COLD partition manager | Shipped |
| Concurrency guard (lock manager, write collision detection) | Shipped |
| HTTP API (FastAPI) | Shipped |
| MCP transport | Shipped |
| CLI entry point (serve / mcp) | Shipped |
| Pydantic schemas | Shipped |

---

## Formal Verification — Phase 2 Complete

| Phase | Work | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 — Model + Safety | TLA+ spec: 7 states, 8 safety invariants, WAL model. TLC verified: 136K states, 0 violations. | **Complete** (9f37dc1) |
| 2 — Liveness | WALCompaction action, 3 liveness properties. TLC verified: 389K states, 0 violations. | **Complete** (ddd7af6) |
| 3 — Generate | Auto-generate transition guard code from formal model | Not started |
| 4 — Integrate | Embed generated guards into Python runtime (ENFORCED mode) | Blocked on Phase 3 |

---

## UX & Efficiency Milestone — Released (2026-05-27, delivered as runtime v0.2.7)

> Note: this roadmap milestone was historically labelled "v0.3.0"; it shipped as
> runtime **v0.2.7**. The runtime semver **v0.3.0** is a later, distinct release
> (FV-PHASE3/4 enforcement + M-009 context-truncation) — see the section below.

**Milestone complete.** All UX & efficiency enhancements shipped. 12 modules, 676 tests.

### Enhancements

| ID | Enhancement | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| ENH-004 | Graduated POV enforcement (STRICT/ADVISORY/SILENT modes) | HIGH | **Shipped v0.2.1** |
| ENH-006 | Delta-only checkpoints: save only changed fields since last checkpoint | MEDIUM | **Shipped v0.2.2** |
| ENH-005 | Conflict auto-categorization: 7 categories, rule-based classifier, auto-resolve | MEDIUM | **Shipped v0.2.7** |
| ENH-007 | Session logger: universal JSONL observability, KernelApp auto-wiring | MEDIUM | **Shipped v0.2.3** |
| ENH-008 | Session/Checkpoint/GC CLI: `session start/close`, `checkpoint`, `gc` commands | MEDIUM | **Shipped v0.2.5** |
| ENH-009 | Spec v3.2.0 kernel enforcement: audit-env, init --requirements, tier gate, echo-back | MEDIUM | **Shipped v0.2.6** |

### Troubleshooting Improvements

| Issue | Current State | Planned Fix |
|---|---|---|
| TS-002 (BOOTING stall) | User must manually confirm tool availability | Auto-detect tool absence, skip verification with logged gap, proceed to fallback chain without blocking |
| TS-005 (Conflict accumulation) | Conflicts grow silently | Add conflict count warning at boot: "X unresolved conflicts consuming ~Y tokens. Review recommended." |
| TS-006 (Session close without audit) | Lost findings if tab closes | Emergency checkpoint before audit — save state first, then audit. Reverses current order. |

---

## v0.3.0 — Released (2026-06-01)

**Runtime release.** Bundles the formal-verification enforcement work with the
kernel-enforced context-truncation policy. 13 modules, 758 tests.

| ID | Item | Status |
|---|---|---|
| FV-PHASE3 | Deterministic TLA+ → Python guard generator (`guardgen` + `generated_guards`) | **Shipped** |
| FV-PHASE4 | Runtime enforces the generated guards; `TRANSITIONS` derived from the verified model; one source of truth | **Shipped** |
| M-009 | Kernel-enforced context-truncation policy: per-region token accounting, deterministic eviction order (HOT never evicted), checkpoint/evict/halt threshold actions, WAL-logged through the proposal pipeline | **Shipped** |

---

## v4.0 — Graph Orchestrator (Released in v0.4.0 — 2026-06-06)

Target: Multi-step workflow orchestration with dependency tracking.

Built incrementally (one milestone per session), behind a deliberate scope
boundary. All seven core increments (1–7) plus runtime-wiring landed on `main`
and **shipped in the single-shot v0.4.0** (2026-06-06), together with DRIFT-ELIM.

| Component | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Pure DAG core | Fail-loud build, topological order + level assignment, guarded node-status lifecycle | Done — increment 1 |
| DAG execution engine | Drives nodes through propose → validate → commit; checkpoint-per-node + `GRAPH_NODE_EXECUTED` WAL event | Done — increment 2 |
| Deterministic-levels scheduling | `Schedule.LEVELS` names parallel-eligible batches; provably equivalent to `SEQUENTIAL`; single-writer enforced | Done — increment 3 |
| Transactional rollback | Opt-in `rollback_on_failure` undoes the whole run to the pre-run baseline via the kernel RECOVERY path | Done — increment 4 |
| Registration | `graph_orchestrator` wired into `_KERNEL_MODULES` / `discover()` / `cmd_health`; module count 13 → 14; health 15/15 | Done — increment 5 |
| OS-process parallel work | `Schedule.PROCESS_LEVELS` — a level's nodes run their pure work in separate OS processes; commit stays serialized in deterministic sorted-id order under the file-mutex | Done — increment 6 |
| Agent / session supervisor | `agent_supervisor.py` — thin observable spawn/monitor/collect layer over the off-process workers (live PID/state/exit code as an `AgentView`); owns no authoritative state; module count 14 → 15; health 16/16 | Done — increment 7 |
| Runtime-wiring | `KernelApp.run_graph` + CLI `graph run` + MCP `rag_graph_run` — invokable through the kernel runtime from a JSON-serializable DAG spec; no new schema/WAL/TLA+; 925 tests, health 16/16 | Done — final gate |
| v4.0 release | Cut the `runtime-v0.4.0` release / tag + publish the headline announcement; headline counts reconciled to a released v0.4.0 | **Shipped — v0.4.0 (2026-06-06)** |

### Prerequisites
- Formal verification Phase 2+ (transition guards must be provably correct before graph nodes enforce them) — **met** (FV-PHASE3/4 enforced at runtime).

## DRIFT-ELIM — Deterministic Project-State Layer (Released in v0.4.0 — 2026-06-06)

Target: eliminate the cross-store status-drift class (E-034 / E-037 / E-039 /
E-040) by giving every tracked project item **one** canonical status, mutated only
through a deterministic, guarded, atomic API — generalizing the `guardgen`
"rules-as-data, fail-loud" discipline to the operating protocol's own state.
Built incrementally behind a deliberate scope boundary; ships together with the
Graph Orchestrator as the single-shot **v0.4.0** (no interim release).

| Component | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Item-lifecycle pure core | `drift_control.py` — `ItemStatus` enum + `LIFECYCLE` table + fail-loud guards + immutable `TrackedItem` (append-only history) | Done — increment 1 |
| Mutation API + migration | `drift_store.py` — `TrackedItemStore` over the canonical `tracked_items` array; guarded transitions, atomic persistence (`.bak` refresh), one-time backlog migration | Done — increment 2 |
| Lifecycle CLI + registration | `rag_kernel resolve\|defer\|reopen\|start\|discard\|supersede` + read-only `items`; `drift_control` + `drift_store` registered (`_KERNEL_MODULES` / `discover()` / `cmd_health`); module count 15 → 17; health 18/18 | Done — increment 3 |
| Renders | `drift_render.py` — deterministic, idempotent renderers regenerate legacy `open_tasks` / `deferred_items` + the ERROR_LOG backlog summary + the Rule 12 status-report backlog *from* the canonical `tracked_items` array (never re-authored); `apply_renders[_file]` rewrite the legacy arrays atomically; `rag_kernel render [--apply]` CLI; `drift_render` registered (critical); module count 17 → 18; health 19/19 | Done — increment 4 |
| Fail-loud session auditor + guarded note verb | `drift_audit.py` — deterministic session-boundary auditor: render parity (legacy arrays == render of `tracked_items`, the E-040 regression) + supersede referential integrity + note/status contradiction (stale-note class INS-038) + no Cowork-memory side stores in the project root (Rule 13 / E-039); `assert_clean` fails loud, `rag_kernel audit [--strict]` CLI. Plus the guarded note-update path (`with_note` → `set_note` → `rag_kernel note`) closing INS-038. `drift_audit` registered (critical); module count 18 → 19; health 20/20; 1082 tests. Dogfooded clean on the project RAG | Done — increment 5 |

---

## MCP Layer for GPT Web (Research)

Target: Give GPT Web real filesystem access without requiring platform changes.

Recommended path: **Local HTTP API + GPT Actions** — user runs `python -m rag_kernel serve` locally, configures GPT custom action pointing to `http://localhost:PORT`. All file operations route through local API. Already supported by v0.1.0+ runtime.

---
